rote (0.2.8-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Moved libncurse5-dev dependency from librote0 to librote-dev.  This now
    makes sense, as there was no point for a runtime library to depend on a
    development library.
  * Updated the FSF postal address in debian/copyright.
  * Updated some incantations in debian/rules to minimize the size of the
    .diff.gz (Thanks to Anibal Monsalve Salazar for the patch).
